      <p>People described Lee Harvey Oswald as an outsider and a troublemaker. He came from a broken home. His mother was a widow and left him in an orphanage for a year when he was a kid. He joined the Marines as a teenager, but couldn’t keep his mouth shut and promoted pro-Soviet propaganda. That didn’t go over well — America was in the heart of the Cold War in the late 1950s.</p>

	<div class="textCon col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
		<p>Finally, the Marines couldn’t take him anymore, and he was discharged — not just for his beliefs, but also for disciplinary issues.</p>
		<p>He then did something that only the most radical, crazy American would even consider. He moved to the Soviet Union.</p>
		<p>The Communists had no idea what to do with him. He seemed unstable and a security risk, as much as a public relations coup. Finally, they decided to let him stay, but shunted him off to a small town in Belarus where they could monitor him. </p>
		<p>They gave him a boring job, and he met his wife, Marina.</p>
		<p>But despite finding love and fulfilling his fantasy of living in a Communist utopia, Oswald wasn’t happy. He didn’t like the job, and he began to see kinks in the system. People were all equal, but some were still more equal than others.</p>

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="textCon col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
		<p>Oswald later decided to return to the U.S., and his wife came with him. He moved back to Texas and found another job that he felt he was too good for. He became interested in Cuba’s version of Communism and there’s speculation he may have developed political ties with the country. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="textCon col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
	    <p>And then, on Nov. 22, 1963, he took his own rifle, climbed to the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository where he worked, leaned out a window and took three shots at the passing motorcade of President John F. Kennedy, hitting him twice.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="imgCon">
		<img class="img-responsive fullimg lazy" data-original="img/oswald4b.jpg"/>
	</div>

	<div class="textCon col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">   
	    <p>And no one knows why, exactly. Oswald was disaffected, but what was he trying to achieve by killing Kennedy?</p>
	    <p>Could a loner with clear Communist ties and sympathies have acted alone to take down the leader of the free world? It didn’t make sense to a lot of people 50 years ago.</p>
	    <p>It doesn’t make sense to a lot of people now.</p>
	    <p>There were a lot of other questions, too. Despite his time in the Marines, Oswald wasn’t that great of a shot, but he struck a moving target twice within seconds, from 175 and then 265 feet away.</p>
	</div>
	    
	<div class="textCon col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> 
	    <p>After the shots were fired, it didn’t look like he had any kind of escape plan. He took a cab, he took a bus, he shot and killed police officer J.D. Tibbit who confronted him. Then he tried to sneak into a movie theater and a theater employee called the police.</p>

	<div class="textCon col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
	    <p>How long would the chase for Kennedy’s killer have lasted if Oswald had just decided to pay for a ticket?</p>
	    <p>Police had a chance to ask him a lot of these questions, but all Oswald would say is that he was a “patsy.” A pawn in someone else’s scheme.</p>
	</div>

	</div>
	
	<div class="textCon col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
	    <p>No one will ever know what Oswald might have later revealed, because he was killed by a Dallas nightclub owner as he was being transferred from city to county jail.</p>
	    <p>Jack Ruby, the man who shot Oswald less than 48 hours after he was arrested, had tenuous ties to the mafia, but he wasn’t believed to be a major player. </p>
	    <p>Ruby told the Warren Commission, the group investigating Kennedy’s assassination, that he would tell them exactly what happened, but only if they transferred him to Washington.</p>
		<p>“I want to tell the truth, and I can’t tell it here,” <a href="http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh5/html/WC_Vol5_0102b.htm" target="_blank">he said</a>. The Warren Commission never transferred Ruby to the nation’s capital, and he later died in prison. He maintained until his death that he wasn’t part of a conspiracy to kill the president.</p>

		<h3>Magic Bullet</h3>

	<div class="imgConTop">

	</div>

    <div class="textCon col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      <p>Kennedy wasn’t the only one struck by the assassin’s bullets on that fateful day in Dallas.</p>
      <p>Texas Gov. John Connally, riding in front of Kennedy in the convertible limousine, was hit by the same bullet that pierced through Kennedy’s neck. Between the two of them, they suffered nine wounds from two bullets that hit the car. Three were fired from Lee Harvey Oswald’s rifle.</p>
      <p>More questions were raised because the bullet that hit Connally was found on his stretcher and barely damaged.  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="imgCon">
		<img class="img-responsive fullimg lazy" data-original="img/bullet3.jpg"/>
	</div>

	<div class="textCon col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      <p>To explain the trajectory of the wounds, the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/index.html" target="_blank">Warren Commission</a> introduced the Single Bullet Theory.</p>
      <p>It holds that the bullet that entered through Kennedy’s back and exited through his throat also caused all five of Gov. Connally's wounds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="imgCon">
		<img class="img-responsive fullimg lazy" data-original="img/bullet4.gif"/>
	</div>

	<div class="textCon col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      
      <p>This means that in addition to the “magic bullet,” one bullet missed the motorcade entirely and another struck Kennedy in the head, killing him. </p>
      <p>The bullet that struck Connally passed through his chest and wrist before embedding itself into his thigh. </p>
    </div>

	<div class="textCon col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      <p>While it may seem to defy common sense, forensics is all about digging below the surface. Experts, after carefully examining all of the factors involved — the velocity of the bullet, the angle of its trajectory, where Kennedy and Connally were seated relative to each other —  proved that the “magic bullet” wasn’t magical at all.</p>
    </div>

	<div class="textCon col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      <p>Still, not everyone is convinced by the diagrams and reams of testimony. Critics insist that one bullet couldn’t have caused so much damage, and Oswald wasn’t a good enough marksman to have pulled off the shots by himself.</p>

	</div>

    <div class="textCon col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      <p>Could Oswald have acted alone?</p>
      <p>Early in his stint in the Marines, Oswald ranked as a sharpshooter out on the firing range, but before he was discharged, his rating fell back to marksman — nothing to be particularly proud of. </p>
      <p>Another factor is the testimony from people in Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination. Several witnesses said they heard shots and saw smoke from a now infamous “grassy knoll” as Kennedy’s limo drove by.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="imgCon">
		<img class="img-responsive fullimg lazy" data-original="img/shooter4.jpg"/>
	</div>

	<div class="textCon col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
	    <p>The Warren Commission disagreed. The 1964 report stated in the strongest terms that Oswald had acted alone, shooting from the book depository.</p>
	</div>

	
	<div class="textCon col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
	    <p>A second investigation 16 years after Kennedy’s death by the House Select Committee on Assassinations also dealt a serious blow to the second shooter theory. During a re-enactment of the assassination, shooters with similar abilities successfully mirrored the shots that killed the president. </p>

	</div>


	<div class="textCon col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
	    <p>Investigators also took the claim that one of the bullets was fired from the front of Kennedy’s limo — rather than from behind, where Oswald was — by pointing out that a prominent crack in the front windshield was actually caused from the inside, not the outside.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="imgCon">

	<div class="textCon col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
	    <p>Finally, modern ballistics tests have proven that the three bullets fired in Dealey Plaza all came from the same gun.</p>
	    <p>Despite the evidence, conspiracy theorists and tourists still make the trek to the grassy knoll to swap stories and memorabilia. </p>

      <p>There wasn't a cloud in the sky as President Kennedy’s motorcade made its way through Dallas, but on the sidewalk, one man held an open black umbrella above his head.</p>

      <p>It sounds unlikely, but it’s not completely bizarre. Umbrellas that fired poison darts were <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/bulgaria-umbrella-georgy-markov-waterloo" target="_blank">used as weapons</a> during the Cold War.</p>

      <p>The CIA is notoriously stealthy, but was the agency capable of assassinating an American president without the world ever finding out? Some conspiracy theorists think so.</p>
      <p>Infamously depicted in the plot of Oliver Stone’s movie “JFK,” the theory that pins President Kennedy’s assassination on the CIA is by far the most convoluted.</p>

      <p>One version of the theory says the CIA was unhappy with Kennedy because of his lukewarm support for the Bay of Pigs invasion — a failed 1961 attempt to overthrow Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. The CIA had trained Cuban expatriates for an invasion of the island. They landed in the Bay of Pigs and the battle ended as a major disaster for the U.S.</p>
      <p>After the Cuba debacle, some in the agency allegedly began to see Kennedy as an obstacle to power. To get him out of the way, the CIA enlisted the help of anti-Castro Cuban revolutionaries to assassinate the president, or so the theory goes. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately for New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison — the only man to ever try anyone in court for Kennedy’s murder — no concrete evidence has come to light to support this theory. </p>

      <p>Garrison prosecuted a businessman named Clay Shaw in a 1969 trial that attempted to link Shaw to a party in New Orleans where anti-Castro activist David Ferrie and Lee Harvey Oswald allegedly discussed killing Kennedy, but Shaw was acquitted. Shaw had informally <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/fall_winter_2001/article02.html" target="_blank">reported to the CIA</a> about observations he made during his frequent trips to Latin America as part of the Domestic Contact Service, but the CIA says he was never formally employed by the agency. </p>
